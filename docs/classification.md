# Classification

Classification tries to find a label for the unlabeled data. In BrainBrowsR's case, we try to find the frequency of the stimulus the user is looking at. There are two main implementations that can be used, [canonical correlation analysis](CCA.md) and methods based on [Riemanian Geometry](riemannian.md).
