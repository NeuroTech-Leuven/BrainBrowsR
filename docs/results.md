## Data

### Equipment

We recorded EEG data using the [Mentalab headset](docs/headset.md) with a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Recording electrodes were placed on O1, Oz, and O2, with the ground and reference on Fz.

The user was seated in front of a laptop with their head about 50 cm away from the screen. We used a laptop with a screen that has a 1920x1080 resolution and a 60 Hz refresh rate. 

### Stimuli 
The user was shown three stimuli that were overlayed on top of [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com).

Each stimulus is a flickering button which is 200x200 pixels large and has a distinct color (red, purple, or black) and frequency (8 Hz, 10 Hz, or 12 Hz). INSERT SCREENSHOT 
### Recordings

To promote user comfort and prevent fatigue, each recording lasted 60 s. These recordings were later cut into 4 s epochs, resulting in 15 epochs per recording.
