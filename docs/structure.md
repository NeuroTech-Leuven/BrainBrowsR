# Structure

Written by: Samuel Berton

In the documentation we try to keep a similar structure, so that it is both easy to write as well as read.  
The goal of the documentation is the following:

    1. Show the workings of the technology,
    2. Explain the reasoning behind each of the implementations,
    3. Give the opportunity to expand on the current project,
    4. Be a scientific explanation of our project.

This means that the documentation has to reflect these basic principles and it should therefore be written in such a way that both non-experts, developers, scientists and others can understand it.

Each documentation file starts with a title. The title explains as short as possible what the file explains.  
Under the title we have the written by part. This is so that people can contact you if something is not clear. Using git, you can have a more detailed history of the file, but the author serves as the responsible of rhtis part of the documentation.

Underneath follow the sections:

    1. Why/ goal: why is this part needed in the project, how is it relevant...
    2. What/ details: explain it in detail, this is more of an abstract part where you focus on the mathematics/ science rather on how you made it in the project
    3. How/ implementation: here you explain your implementation, try to reason with the author why you did certain actions or used certain packages/ technologies. Make sure to use links and citations.
    4. Results: what is the result of your implementation. This could be a graph, video, picture. This is particularly important for data-team.
    5. Sources: where can people find more info on the discussed topic.
