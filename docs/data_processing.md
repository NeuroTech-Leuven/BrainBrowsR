# Data processing

On the surface data-processing consists of two main parts: classification and pre-processing. 

## Pre-processing

Pre-processing removes noise from the raw EEG-data. To learn more about pre-processing, see [dedicated page](preprocessing.md).

## Classifcation

After the data has been pre-processed, it can be classified to see which frequency is dominant in the signal. This is described on [this page](classification.md).
