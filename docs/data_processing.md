# Data processing

On the surface, data-processing consists of two main parts: pre-processing and classification.

## Pre-processing

Pre-processing prepares the raw EEG-data to be usable for classification. To learn more about pre-processing, see [dedicated page](./data_processing/preprocessing.md).

## Classifcation

After the data has been pre-processed, it can be classified to see which frequency is dominant in the signal. This is described on [this page](./data_processing/classification.md).
