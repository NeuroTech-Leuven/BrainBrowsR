# Documentation

This is the developer documentation for the BrainBrowsR project by NeuroTech Leuven. The project consists of two main parts, a front-end and and a back-end. These are then connected through [websockets](websockets.md). The global structure that connects everything can be found in [here](global_structure.md).

## Back-end

The back-end of BrainBrowR consists of two parts, a websockets server and the classification pipeline. To learn more about websockets, go to the documentation in [this document](websockets.md). To learn more about the classification pipeline, you can read it [here](classification.md).

## Front-end

The front-end is the extension. This inserts the stimuli and interacts with the webpage using the input from the back-end. To learn more about the extension, see [here](extension.md)
