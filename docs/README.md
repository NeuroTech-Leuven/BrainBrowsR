# Documentation

This is the developer documentation for the BrainBrowsR project by NeuroTech Leuven. The project consists of two main parts, a back-end and and a front-end. These are then connected through [websockets](websockets.md). The global structure that connects everything can be found [here](global_structure.md).

## Back-end

The back-end of BrainBrowR consists of two parts, the websockets server and the data-processing pipeline. To learn more about websockets, go to the documentation in [this document](websockets.md). To learn more about the data-processing pipeline, go to the documentation [here](data_processing.md).

## Front-end

The front-end is the extension. This inserts the stimuli and interacts with the webpage using the input from the back-end. To learn more about the extension, see [here](extension.md)
